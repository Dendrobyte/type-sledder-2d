## Installation / Development

Mostly for my future self, should I switch machines...

For the game itself, you'll need to install [Love2D][http://www.love2d.org]. I have the following alias set up to run `love .` from the terminal.

For the build script, I use [butler](https://itch.io/docs/butler/installing.html#on-macos) to upload to itch io.

```bash
alias love='/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love'
alias butler='/Applications/butler/butler'
```

## Style Guidelines / Reminders

- When updating graphics and colors, whenever it changes it must be reset a default of (1, 1, 1) at the end
